## 1. Based on circus-starter

So clone a download a copy of this repository, and get it started in terminal or using Prepros, whichever you prefer.

## 2. Make a working todo list.

Type in the box, click add, it goes on the list. Check the box, it dissappears. Easy!

## 3. Add extra features

Make it keep the counters at the bottom up-to-date. Make the 'clear finished items' button work.
